Fix signal and bootloop for OnePlus 13 CN on OxygenOS 15 / 16.

[Download](https://github.com/K58/fix-signal-oneplus13/releases)

## Tutorial

### How to fix signal

Download and install this module in Magisk (or other root manager).

### How to fix bootloop

Make sure you have this module installed before OTA updates.

1. Finish an OTA system update, but DO NOT click Restart.

2. If you are updating to **OxygenOS 15**, press the "Action" button under the module name in Magisk (or other root manager), make sure the patch is successful.
    - Note: **OxygenOS 16** does not require bootloop fix. If you are updating to OxygenOS 16, you can skip this step and proceed to step 3.

3. You MUST also install Magisk (or other root manager) to inactive slot.
    - For Magisk: Magisk Manager -> Home -> Magisk (Install) -> Install to Inactive Slot (After OTA)

4. Press "Restart" in System Update

> [!WARNING]  
> This module will patch `dtbo` partition to fix bootloop.<br>
> DO NOT lock the bootloader with modified `dtbo` (or any other partition) in **any** slot.

### How to relock bootloader

**Please don't.**

Your device will **brick** if you relock the bootloader with any modifications to the system partition in **any** slot (e.g., root, dtbo, custom kernel, etc.).

> [!CAUTION]
> **This module is for rooted users. You MUST keep your bootloader unlocked.**<br>
> To relock the bootloader, you must remove root and restore the device to stock state.
> Do not relock your bootloader unless you fully understand what you are doing.<br>
> On OnePlus 13, you cannot access fastboot again via key combination if the bootloader is locked.
>
> If **any** of the following are not met, relocking the bootloader **will brick your device**:
>
> * **Every partition in BOTH slots must be 100% stock and unmodified.**
>   * To ensure this, after you restore the stock OS of your device, download the full OTA ROM (.zip) for your current OS version and local install it TWICE: local install, then reboot, then local install it AGAIN.
> * **Google account must be removed.**
>   * On older ColorOS / OxygenOS versions, due to a critical bug, FRP (Factory Reset Protection, a.k.a. activation lock) prevents completing the initial setup, effectively bricking it.
